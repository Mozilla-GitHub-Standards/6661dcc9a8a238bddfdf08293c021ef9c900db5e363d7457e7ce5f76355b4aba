# IT SRE Delegated role
Repo that creates roles on accounts that allows cross account access from another account. It will create 3 different roles.

 * itsre-admin		- Admin role
 * itsre-readonly	- Readonly role
 * itsre-poweruser	- Similar to admin but can't do any IAM tasks

This repo contains 3 different methods on how to do it, but in reality you should just use terraform :)
